# Ping-Pong
Ping-Pong Game</br>
After lots of tutorials that I watched and learned from, I created a "Ping-Pong Game" using Java. Of course, I used Stackoverflow(and similar), YouTube, etc. to help me create this simple application.</br>
I have a working pom.xml file that compiles, tests and installs the project using Jenkins. I've created several unit tests to ensure the integrity of the application.</br>
Jenkins build is successful - Jenkinsfile is present in the GitHub repo for further review if you want.</br>
The only thing that I still don't fully understand is how to deploy it.</br>
